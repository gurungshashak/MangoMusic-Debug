-- Looks like the SUM calculation was wrong 
-- what it was doing was tell permuim = 1 and free play = 4 then divided by 100 
-- it sould have been 0.004 for permuim and 0.001 for free play






-- Fix 
-- SUM code update permuim to 0.004 and 0.001 for free play
-- remove the /1000 because they are already in their rate
